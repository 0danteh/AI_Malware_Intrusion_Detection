# Malware Detection System

This project aims at detecting the intrusion of external malwares into a certain system through the heuristic analysis-based antivirus protocol. This means that the program will study and analyse the underlying patterns of exisisting malwares (imported from theZoo git repo) and it will detect when a similar malicious software is introduced within a system.

# Overview

1. **Data Acquisition**: To begin, safely acquire malware samples from theZoo by executing `git clone https://www.github.com/ytisf/theZoo`. Navigate to the cloned repository and install the necessary dependencies with `pip install --user -r requirements.txt`.
**WARNING: HANDLE WITH EXTREME CAUTION.** You are about to interact with real malware, which poses a threat to your system. Only proceed for research purposes and within the confines of a Virtual Machine to prevent any unintended harm.

2. **Data Preparation**: The system starts by unzipping malware and safeware samples from a specified directory. It then converts these binary files into images, which are resized to a uniform size.

3. **Data Conversion**: The system converts the resized images into 2D numpy arrays, which are then used to train a CNN model.

4. **Model Training:** A CNN model is trained on the converted data, with the goal of learning to distinguish between malware and safeware samples.

5. **Prediction and Evaluation**: The trained model is used to make predictions on a test set, and its performance is evaluated based on the loss and accuracy metrics.

# Prerequisites

To run this system, you will need:
- Python 3.x
The following Python libraries:
- numpy
- opencv-python
- imageio
- imghdr
- tensorflow

You can install these libraries using pip:
```
pip install numpy opencv-python imageio imghdr tensorflow
```

# Usage
1. **Prepare the Data**: Ensure that the directories specified in the code (ZOO_DIR, RAW_DIR, MALWARE_RAW, MALWARE_IMAGE, MALWARE_RESIZED, SAFEWARE_RAW, SAFEWARE_IMAGE, and SAFEWARE_RESIZED) exist and contain the necessary files.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script using the Python interpreter:
```
python malware_detection.py
```

# Testing Considerations
Testing this system can be challenging due to the potential security risks associated with handling malware samples. Malware can contain harmful payloads that, if executed, could compromise the security of the testing environment. Therefore, it is recommended to run this system in a controlled and isolated environment, such as a virtual machine or a dedicated testing server, to minimize the risk of security breaches.
